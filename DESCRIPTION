Description: Provides constructions of series of partially balanced incomplete block designs (PBIB) based on the combinatory method S, introduced by Rezgui et al. (2014) <doi:10.3844/jmssp.2014.45.48>. This package also offers the associated U-type designs. Version 1.1-1 generalizes the approach to designs with v = wnl treatments. It includes various rectangular and generalized rectangular right angular association schemes with 4, 5, and 7 associated classes.
